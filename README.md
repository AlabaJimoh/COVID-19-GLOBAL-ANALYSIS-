# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). It explores cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time across selected countries and presents key insights through visualizations and a well-documented Jupyter Notebook.

## Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze time trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare metrics across Kenya, the USA, and India
- Visualize trends using charts and maps
- Communicate insights through code, visuals, and narrative

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly.express (for choropleth map)
- NumPy

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Download the dataset from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv) and save it as `owid-covid-data.csv` in the same folder.
3. Open `COVID19_Tracker_Refined.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run all cells in sequence (Cell > Run All).

## Insights and Reflections

- The United States consistently showed the highest case count among selected countries.
- India experienced a sharp spike during the second wave.
- Kenyaâ€™s vaccination efforts accelerated in late 2021.
- Death rates and vaccination progress vary significantly by country.

## Deliverables

- `COVID19_Tracker_Refined.ipynb`: Full analysis notebook
- (Optional) PDF export for presentation
